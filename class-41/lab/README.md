# LAB - React Native - Milestone 1: MVP

Create your first native phone/device application using React Native, tapping into at least 2 phone features.

## Before you begin

Refer to *Getting Started*  in the [lab submission instructions](../../../reference/submission-instructions/labs/README.md) for complete setup, configuration, deployment, and submission instructions.

Create a new GitHub repository titled with your course code and this lab number (i.e. js-401n15-class-10)

You will be submitting the URL to the README (docs) at the root of this repository for your assignment.

## Getting Started

### Remote Development (Optional)

- Create an account at <https://expo.io>
- Confirm login for <https://snack.expo.io>

### Local Development (Required)

It is more powerful and flexible to have a local development environment. It is also a LOT more work than using online developer tools, especially on Windows.

**NOTE:** The online/remote tools may be sufficient for your needs.

> **Confirm the following**

- Install XCode (Mac Users)
- Install Android Studio (All Users)
  - Install 1 device emulator
- Install expo-cli
- Create google play and apple developer accounts

## Assignment

Over the next 2 lab coding sessions, you will create your first Phone App. What it does and how it looks is up to you. This is an opportunity to play around with whats possible in React Native and to get a feel for how you can get into the various device features.

This is a 2-session assignment, after which you will live-demo your phone app to the class (at the start of class 43)

**Lab/Coding Session #1** - Focus on getting your dev system up and operational, getting "proof of life" and reaching your MVP in terms of baseline functionality

**Lab/Coding Session #2** - Add in the device features, polish, and prepare for deployments.

### Requirements

- Use at least 1 native device feature (Contacts, Camera, GPS, etc)
- High Fidelity Styling and UX
  - Good starting points:
    - [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/)
    - [Builder X](https://builderx.io/)
- Properly Documented for End Users
- Live Demo & Presentation

### Milestone 1 - MVP (This Lab)

- Deliver your MVP for raw functionality
- Your dev environment should be properly working
- Other users should be able to scan your QR and see your app on any device
- All of your core "features" should be working properly
  - Un-Styled is fine. We're looking for things to buzz, light up, detect movement, etc.

### Documentation

For this assignment, instead of writing developer documentation, write end user documentation.

"How do I use this application"

We recommend using the "Steve Jobs" standards, which is to say that your app should be so easy to use and should do such an obvious thing that documentation isn't required.

That said ... it's required. Shoot for the Jobs standard, but document this like you're going to sell it on the *App Store* (you might)
