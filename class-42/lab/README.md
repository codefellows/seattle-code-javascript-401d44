# LAB - React Native - Milestone 2: Polish and Delivery

Complete the work on your phone application.

You will be presenting your application live to your class

## Assignment Recap

Create your first Phone App. What it does and how it looks is up to you.

### Application Requirements

- Use 2 screens / components
- Use and share state between components/screens
- Use at least 1 native device feature (Contacts, Camera, GPS, etc)
- Properly Documented for End Users
- Live Demo & Presentation

### Milestone 2 - Product Delivery (This Lab)

As you complete your RNA, switch your focus to the user experience.

- Quality and Thoughtful Styling using `css-in-js`
- Right sized tap targets, good contrast
- Dark and Light Modes
- Well thought through UX
  - Be considerate of individuals that primarily use their thumbs, left or right hands

### Stretch Goal

- Deploy to an app store!
- At minimum, you can do an "In Development" deployment, not publicly published

### Delivery

In addition to the End User documentation noted in the app requirements, you will be presenting your application live to the class.

Prepare a good working demo, be ready to jump into code sample and answer questions related to "How the heck did you do that??"
