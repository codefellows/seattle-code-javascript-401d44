## Code Review: React Native

* Deploying our Expo Apps
  * Does your app run on a simulator.
    * You won't be able to make phone calls on the simulator.
  * Does your app run on your phone / expo go.
  * Steps:
    * make sure you app.json has all the info specified from expo
    * Toubleshooting:
      * Does expo go open?
      * Does the URL vs the QR have a different result.
      * Log into your account, and does the app run on expo.dev?
* Deploying on App Stores.

## Discussion on Ethics in Tech

What is Ethics vs Morals?

* Ethics:
  * How you go about doing something in a certain place.
  * Sense of right and wrong / societal standards.
* Morals:
  * Morals are more individual thing.
    * What about global morals.
* What is the difference between the 2:
  * ethics is society / morals maybe one person.
  * Things that inherintly bad vs, things that we agree are bad.
* Ethics are what we should do, morals are what what we feel.
  * Very human centric / is it clear cut.
    * Answering "what should we do" is very hard
    * standards are subjective.
      * How to we agree about standards.
    * How does culture factor in.
* Are there things we might all feel are right / wrong.
  * Absolute right and wrong truths.
  * Is there a comparsison that makes this clear.
  * Subjectivity in our feelings.
* Why do we study / need ethics?
  * To promote and ensure a level of fairness.
  * Making sure we don't harm yourself and others.
  * Our feelings don't always produce good outcomes for others.

Let's discuss the readings.

* Ethics in the Workplace: is our workplace / leadership doing what's best for "us" (society)
  * Amazon - cancelling contract with Law Inforcement for facial recognition software.
    * Eveyone agrees that laws are good, and we want better law enforcement standards.
    * Workers think law enforcement will misuse this.
      * banned the software last year (amazon Rekognition).
    * Who owns our data / private stuff.
    * EULA (end user licence agreement) can be very scary.
      * we need to change the process (Jacob's  hot take).
  * Is big data a civil right issue:
    * Health insurers making suggestions to customers based on health data.
      * Some solutions intruduce more considerations / issues.
      * What are the unforeseen things that happen.
  * Developer builds a quiz for medication (to see if you should take it):
    * Developer tells manager that the quiz is always recommending medication.
      * users are teen girls, bad side effects
      * Your girl commits suicide and developer feels bad.
      * Who is at fault, how can we prevent?
      * A little more subtle type of ethical consideration.
      * Told his sister to stop taking medication, but kept it to himself ultimately.
      * Does the doctor have a role in this scenrio?
        * more than one place that this should have been stopped.
    * Did his morals and ethics align?
* Ethics in Technology: is our tech doing what's best for "us" (society)
  * self - driving cars:  prepgrammed devices,  people have to tell what the car should do?
    * what happens in ethically curious scenarios.
    * Taking a nihilistic (nothin matters) approach
      * Cars dont' have any morals (take the difficult decision out).
      * How do you sell a car that will Kill you instead of a bus of children.
    * Who wants to be responisible for any of these outcomes.
      * Leadership / Managers / Developers
      * Policy on automated devices?
      * Do we need the control to fall to the end user, or programmers.
      * Who gets to make that decision.
    * Making assumptions as a user.
      * Self driving cars presumptive have more information about the situation.
      * It's a new thing and we have more questions.
      * We are the first group of people that have to deal with these.
      * standardization of decisions (what are the ethics)

### Takaways

* In addition to making great code, we need to focus on the why!
  * You are in control of what you make, your decisions matter.
